Final Assignment

The hard part of the assignment was learning html as I was completely unfamiliar with it,  but it wasn't too bad.

In the app.py, I just created new routes to the different pages.

In homepage.html,  I had a heading, an image, and 3 hyperlinks. Two to other pages on my site, and another to reddit.

In assignments.html, I had a heading and I summarized each of our homework assignments and listed my favorite one.

In myclasses.html, I created a table which had my classes  order by which day they are on. I then list my favorite class and explain.
